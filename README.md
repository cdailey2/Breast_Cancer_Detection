# Exploring the Efficacy of Supervised Machine Learning Models in Breast Cancer Detection Based on Cellular Characteristics

## Objective
This project aims to create verbose supervised machine learning models to detect malignant breast cancer tumors based on cellular characteristics and compare and contrast strengths and weaknesses of respective models as well as discuss possible use cases within the medical field. More on the rationale for this project can be found in the [project documentation](https://github.com/cdailey2/Breast_Cancer_Detection/blob/main/docs/project_documentation.md).
